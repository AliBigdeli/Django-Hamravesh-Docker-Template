# Goal
This project main goal is to provide a simple way to deploy a django project into hamravesh service provider.

# Development usage
You'll need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
It's available on Windows, macOS and most distros of Linux. 

If you're using Windows, it will be expected that you're following along inside
of [WSL or WSL
2](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/a-linux-dev-environment-on-windows-with-wsl-2-docker-desktop-and-more).

That's because we're going to be running shell commands. You can always modify
these commands for PowerShell if you want.


## Clone the repo
Clone this repo anywhere you want and move into the directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AliBigdeli/Django-HamraveshTest-App.git
```

## Enviroment Varibales
enviroment varibales are included in docker-compose.yml file for debugging mode and you are free to change commands inside:

```docker
services:
  backend:
    command: sh -c "python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"
    environment:      
      - DEBUG=True
```

## Build everything

*The first time you run this it's going to take 5-10 minutes depending on your
internet connection speed and computer's hardware specs. That's because it's
going to download a few Docker images and build the Python + requirements dependencies.*

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Now that everything is built and running we can treat it like any other Django
app.

## Note

If you receive an error about a port being in use? Chances are it's because
something on your machine is already running on port 8000. then you have to change the docker-compose.yml file according to your needs.
## Check it out in a browser

Visit <http://localhost:8000> in your favorite browser.

# Testing Usage
## running all tests
```sh
docker compose run --rm backend sh -c " black -l 79 && flake8 && python manage.py test" -v core:/app
```
or
```sh
docker compose exec backend sh -c sh -c " black -l 79 && flake8 && python manage.py test" 
```
